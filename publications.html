    <p><strong>Abstract</strong> <br> Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the essential part of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) core which performs arithmetical operations such as addition,
      subtraction, division, multiplication etc., logical operations such as and, or, xor etc. and shift-rotate operations. The CPU performance is directly related
      to the performance of ALU. In this study, the 64-bit ALU has been designed by using the Very High Speed Integrated Circuits Hardware Description
      Language (VHDL) and Altera Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) families, synthesized and simulated with the help of Altera Quartus II (Intel, Santa
      Clara, CA, USA) v13.0sp1 and Modelsim-Altera v10.1d (Intel, Santa Clara, CA, USA) software. Many different studies are given about ALU Design and
      Implementation with the use of FPGA architecture and VHDL language. The difference of this study from recent studies is that the proposed design
      allows the processing of the signed numbers. Also, Conditional Sum Adder (COSA) is used in addition operation instead of Carry Ripple Adder (CRA) or
      Carry Look-ahead Adder (CLA) because of its benefit in fast addition and less propagation delay of Carry Chain. </p>

        nm FinFET Technology-Based Floating Current Source</a> <strong>– April 2021</strong></li>
        <p><strong>Abstract</strong> <br> Fin type Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) technology is a promising technology for single-digit nanometric dimensions. FinFETs are used to increase the performance by reducing the power consumption as the two gate voltages are controlled dependent and/or independently. This work explores the design of a Floating Current Source (FCS) using Double Gate (DG) FinFET and its application of a universal filter. The designed FinFET based FCS operates at 0.15 V power supply, the power consumption of the circuit is 51nW and bandwidth is approximately 100 MHz. The proposed FCS based filter circuit is simulated in LTspice with the FinFET 45 nm PTM-MG model. The filter topology behavior has been tested with an experimental study using the LM13700 integrated circuit and the experimental results are demonstrated. The proposed FinFET based circuit and its application can be used for the design of systems that require low power consumption and low chip area.</p>
